# Alignment-Stress-Testing-and-Transferability-Simulator-Synthetic-Evaluation-Harness
A reproducible script proof-of-concept that simulates jailbreak-style stress tests across model and safety variants, computes ASR with Wilson confidence intervals, analyzes severity-weighted risk, and visualizes adversarial transferability with figures and tables.
